# Comments on page-proof: Wedel &amp; Taylor on bifurcated cervical ribs

Happily, not many changes are required to the proof. However, some of them are very significant.

* page 91: "suggested title change - please approve or not". Yes, the suggested change to "The biomechanical significance of bifurcated cervical ribs of apatosaurine sauropods" is an improvement.

* page 91, column 2, paragraph 1: "LACM, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, Los Angeles, California, US". The last part should read "USA".
* p91, c2, p1: "Museum of Western Colorado - Dinosaur Journey". The hyphen in the name should be an em-dash (as it is in the acknowledgements).

* p93: "please send higher resolution replacement for this figure". The current version of the illustration is 1000 pixels wide, which for a single-column figure of about 3.33 inches, is 300 dpi. That would usually be considered more than sufficient resolution.

* p94, caption to Figure 3. Parts A-C of this caption are correct, but parts D and E should read as follows:
> D, _Apatosaurus louisae_, MWC 1946, cervical vertebra in right lateral view. E, _Apatosaurus louisae_, MWC 5659, cervical vertebra in left lateral view (reversed).

* p96: caption to Figure 5: "in right anteroventrolateral view". Should read "in left anteroventrolateral view".

* p98: caption to Figure 7: "C, ounted skeleton of Apatosaurus louisae in the Carnegie Museum" is missing the capital "M" of "Mounted".
* p98: caption to Figure 7: "skull and first six and a half cervical vertebrae" should read "seven and a half".

* p99: "please check authors' initials". Yes, the is correct, thank you for fixing our inconsistency here.
