# Comments on page-proof: Wedel &amp; Taylor on bifurcated cervical ribs

Happily, not many changes are required to the proof. However, some of them are very significant.

* page 91: "suggested title change - please approve or not". Yes, the suggested change is an improvement, but we would prefer it to read "... bifurcated cervical ribs <i>in</i> apatosaurine sauropods". So, in full:
> The biomechanical significance of bifurcated cervical ribs in apatosaurine sauropods

* page 91, column 2, paragraph 1: "LACM, Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, Los Angeles, California, US". The last part should read "USA".
* p91, c2, p1: "Museum of Western Colorado - Dinosaur Journey". The hyphen in the name should be an em-dash (as it is in the acknowledgements).

* p93: "please send higher resolution replacement for this figure". The current version of the illustration is 1000 pixels wide, which for a single-column figure of about 3.33 inches, is 300 dpi. That would usually be considered more than sufficient resolution.

* p94, caption to Figure 3. Parts A-C of this caption are mostcorrect, but parts D and E should read as follows:
> D, _Apatosaurus louisae_, MWC 1946, cervical vertebra in right lateral view. E, _Apatosaurus louisae_, MWC 5659, cervical vertebra in left lateral view (reversed).

* We would also like to insert "in lateral view" at the end of the part of the caption for part B, so the whole caption should now read as follows:
> **Figure 3.** Bifurcated and incipiently bifurcated cervical ribs of sauropods. A, _Moabosaurus utahensis_ holotype individual, left cervical rib BYU 14063 (not right as stated by Britt et al. 2017), probably associated with C5, in medial view. B, _Dicraeosaurus hansemanni_ holotype MB.R.2379, right cervical rib 8 in lateral view. Modified from (Janensch 1929, fig. 21). C, _Brontosaurus parvus_ CM 555, right cervical rib 7 in lateral view. D, _Apatosaurus louisae_, MWC 1946, cervical vertebra in right lateral view. E, _Apatosaurus louisae_, MWC 5659, cervical vertebra in left lateral view (reversed). All photographs by authors.

* p96: caption to Figure 5: "in right anteroventrolateral view". Should read "in left anteroventrolateral view".

* p98: caption to Figure 7: "C, ounted skeleton of Apatosaurus louisae in the Carnegie Museum" is missing the capital "M" of "Mounted".
* p98: caption to Figure 7: "skull and first six and a half cervical vertebrae" should read "seven and a half".
* p98: caption to Figure 7: Both occurrences of "of the nex" should read "of a more anterior vertebra". Putting it all together, the caption for Figure 7 should read as follows:
> **Figure 7.** Schematic reconstructions of ventral neck musculature in two diplodocid sauropods. A, _Apatosaurus louisae_ holotype CM 3018, cervicals 6 and 7 in left lateral view (reversed), modified from Gilmore 1936, plate 24. B, _Diplodocus carnegie_ holotype CM 84, cervicals 6 and 7 in right lateral view, modified from Hatcher 1901, plate 3. C, Mounted skeleton of _Apatosaurus louisae_ in the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, skull and first seven and a half cervical vertebrae in right posterolateral view. Red lines represent the longus colli ventralis muscles, originating on the anterior aspect of one cervical rib and inserting on the shaft of a more anterior vertebra. Blue lines represent the flexor colli lateralis muscles, originating on the anterior aspect of the tuberculum of one vertebra and inserting on the dorsal part of the shaft of a more anterior vertebra. In _Apatosaurus_ the attachment areas are all much larger: in particular, the insertion of the flexor colli lateralis is increased in size by the incipient bifurcation.


* p99: "please check authors' initials". Yes, this is correct, thank you for fixing our inconsistency here.
