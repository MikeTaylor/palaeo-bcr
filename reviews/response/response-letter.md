# RESPONSE TO REVIEWS: Bifucated Cervical Ribs (Wedel and Taylor)

Please accept our apologies for the slow response to these very helpful reviews. Unhappily, they arrived just before the corresponding author went on a two-week vacation which necessitated an intense week of catching up on returning. We are now pleased to present our revised manuscript.


## Comments from Yan-Yin Wang

We thank Dr. Wang for his constructive comments. In several places in the manuscript we have adopted the alternative wordings that he suggested.

His annotated manuscript appeared in places to have suffered from accidental copy-pastes, but we think we have understood where these occurred and have allowed for them.

## Comments by Jerry Harris

We are grateful to Dr/ Harris for his characteristiclally detailed but good-spirited review, and have accepted most of his suggested changes. We are especially grateful to Harris for spotting that we cited one of our own figures incorrectly (the _Carnosaurus_ cervical ribs), for pointing out the correct new generic name of _Sclerostropheus_ (= “_Tanystropheus_”) _fossai_, and for spotting a missing reference.

Among those suggestions that we have not followed:
* We judged that some wording changes in the abstract and elsewhere did not improve clarity.
* The terms "ansa costotransversaria", "flexor colli lateralis" and "longus colli ventralis" were italicised in the annotated manuscript, but these appears in the literature in both Roman and italic settings, and we prefer the former since for its lack of visual noise.

## Editor's changes

We have accepted all the formatting changes made by the editor in his copy of the manuscript, with the following exceptions:

* "Marsh (1896:plate XX:figs. 3–4)" was changed to "Marsh (1896:plate XX, figs. 3–4)" (i.e. a colon replaced by a comma). We have retained our original punctuation here as figures 2 and 4 are part of Marsh's plate XX, not other parts of the same paper that we are also referring to.
* Our multi-part citation of "Bonaparte et al. 1990, fig. 24D; Fig. 3" was changed to "Bonaparte et al. 1990, figs. 24D, 3" but this is incorrect: the Fig. 3 that we are referring to is our own, not that of Bonaparte (hence the scapitalization of "Fig.").
* In our citation "Spiekman and Scheyer (2019:25)", the page-number was removed. We prefer to retain this for the convenience of the reader.
* In "The _Apatosaurus louisae_ holotype CM 3018" parentheses were suggested around the specimen number. But the specimen number is not a parenthetical aside here but a specifier.
* Similarly, parenthesis were erronously suggested around the specimen number in "the referred _Apatosaurus louisae_ (specimen MWC 5659)".
* Only with a heavy heart have we accepted the truncation of authors' first names in the bibliography to initials. As scientists, we deprecate all loss of information, but while this remains the journal's policy, we'll cope. The same goes for the loss of italics for journal titles.

We trust that the chnages made in the revised manuscript will prove satisfactory.
