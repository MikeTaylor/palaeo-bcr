We have accepted all the formatting changes made by the editor in his copy of the manuscript, with the following exceptions:

* "Marsh (1896:plate XX:figs. 3–4)" was changed to "Marsh (1896:plate XX, figs. 3–4)" (i.e. a colon replaced by a comma). We have retained our original punctuation here as figures 2 and 4 are part of plate XX, not other parts of the same paper that we are also referring to.
* Our multi-part citation of "Bonaparte et al. 1990, fig. 24D; Fig. 3" was changed to "Bonaparte et al. 1990, figs. 24D, 3" but this is incorrect: the Fig. 3 that we are referring to is our own, not that of Bonaparte.
* In our citation "Piekman and Scheyer (2019:25)", the page-number was removed. We prefer to retain this.
* In "The Apatosaurus louisae holotype CM 3018" parentheses were suggested around the specimen number. But the specimen number is not a parenthetical aside here but a specifier.
* Similarly, parenthesis were erronously suggested around the specimen number in "the referred Apatosaurus louisae (specimen MWC 5659)".
* Only with a heavy heart have we accepted the truncation of authors' first names in the bibliography to initials. As scientists, we deprecate all loss of information, but while this remains the journal's policy, we'll cope. The same goes for the loss of italics for journal titles.
